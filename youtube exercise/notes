difference between tuple and list:

1) we use [] to include elements in a list while () for tuple.

2) tuple is not mutable while list is mutable.

Set:
{}
unordered, no duplicates

unordered means every time you executed, it turns out different ordered_elements set.

usercase:

to check membership
go to 'list_tuple_set.py' for details
print('Math' in set1)

how to create empty list, tuple and set?

list

empty_list = list()

tuple

empty_tuple = ()
empty_tuple = tuple()

set
